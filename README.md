# Notes app

[Live version](https://al-moreton.github.io/notes-app/)

## How it's made?
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First project built using class constructors. There are no variables declared on the global scope, and the project is called using a singular method.

## Things I would like to add
- Ability to select pre-existing tags (from an array of objects)
- If no tag found when searching for one, then the tag is created
- A way to add different types of notes (checklists, images)
